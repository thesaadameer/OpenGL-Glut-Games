Project 1: In project 1, a TV is created and you can turn the TV on and the ship will start moving on the TV. There are on/off and start/pause buttons. This means the user can turn the TV on or off and make the ship start or pause by pressing the buttons.

Project 2: In project 2, spaceships firing games is made. You can fire at other spaceships by pressing spacebar and the bullets missed and spaceships fired are being counted.

Project 3: In project 3, a spaceship docking game is created. Wherever you click on the screen a small spaceship appears, which then follows the big ship that is moving in a circular motion and docks inside of it.
